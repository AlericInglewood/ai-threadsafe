//                m_head

// where '--->' means "points to the node",

//
// Apply one push on an empty list:

//   m_tail ---> m_stub ===> node1 ===> nullptr
//                             ^
//                             |
//                           m_head

// A list with one or more nodes:
//
//   m_tail ---> [m_stub ===>] node1 ===> node2 ===> ... ===> nodeN ===> nullptr
//                                                              ^

//
// If no pop was performed since the last time the list was empty,
// then m_tail points to m_stub. If one or more pop's where performed
// not leading to an empty list then m_tail points to the next node
// that will be popped.
//
// Because the last line in push fixes the m_next pointer that m_head was
// pointing at (from nullptr to the new node), a list that has a few nodes
// pushed concurrently can also look like this:
//
//   m_tail ---> [m_stub ===>] node1 ===> node2 ===> ... ===> nodeK ===> nullptr, nodeL ===> nullptr, nodeM ===> nullptr, nodeN ===> nullptr
//                                                                                                                          ^
//                                                                                                                          |
//                                                                                                                        m_head
// Where the m_next pointers of nodes K, L and M are filled in "later" in any order, to end as
//
//   m_tail ---> [m_stub ===>] node1 ===> node2 ===> ... ===> nodeK ===> nodeL ===> nodeM ===> nodeN ===> nullptr
//                                                                                               ^
//                                                                                               |

//
// Hence, trying to pop a node that was already pushed might fail (returning nullptr) if
// not all previous pushes also finished.
//
// This half finished list might get repaired in any order, so it might already be partially
// linked. Also, due to concurrent execution of pop on a list with one element, and multiple pushes,
// the most general unfinished state of the list might something like:
//
// m_tail ---> node3 [===> node4...] ===> nullptr, node5 [===> node6...] ===> nullptr, ..., nodeN ===> nullptr
//                                                                                            ^
//                                                                                            |
//                                                                                          m_head
//
// where any of the nodes node4 or higher can be m_stub. Combining that with the
// previous possibility where m_tail still points to m_stub from the beginning,
// m_tail basically is a pointer to a possibly yet incompletely linked list of
// nodes where zero or one node might be m_stub (which should be skipped when
// encountered). Except for an empty list, because there has to be always at
// least one node in the list; so in that case m_stub is always there.
